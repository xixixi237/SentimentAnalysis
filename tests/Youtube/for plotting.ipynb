In all of the time they attended local constituency meetings (both are getting on now and rarely attend meetings now) they never once heard anything that they regarded as an anti-Semitic slur, or abuse or opinion. However they occasionally heard anti-black racist comments and often heard Islamophobic opinions expressed by members. There was push-back against those expressing those opinions from other members (sometimes from my parents) but nevertheless it shows 2 things. First the AS issue was wildly overstated, although I think most Novara viewers know that. But secondly, it shows that Labour does have a racism problem and its mostly expressed as Islamophobia.

They retreat back to the familiar, and latch onto it with both hands because it's the only way to make sense of an endlessly grey world.

However, we were close enough to talk about anything at anytime, and she acknowledged her upbringing, but was never prejudice, even to myself, a person of color. \n\nAt our graduation, we were lined up infront for handshaking and congratulations from all the parents and friends who showed up. Some refused to shake our hands,  acknowledge our existence, or our commitment to our nation. It's a hard pill to swallow, but I can live happily knowing that my classmates did not have the same ideology as their parents. I serve my country proudly, regardless having to protect people with different ideologies."

           "While the issue is certainly multifactorial, It appears to be a deadly combination of generational prejudice and hatred seeping out and the lack of support upon being discharged/ retiring from the military. Many crave the structure, discipline, and comradery they experienced while in the military and which is severely lacking in the civilian realm and something they find in these 'brotherhood' type extremist groups. My dad served 30 years in the Army and eventually retired two years ago. I know it was a very sad day for him as it had been a part of his life for 30 years and had been the reason for his success in life ( he was a JAG and eventually retired as an '06). The army gave our family many adventures including living overseas for many years and it was a time that while stressful (especially when my dad deployed) it was certainly something created a close bond between us. My dad ended up taking a high position in the social security administration and is currently still successful but i know many others  who struggle. My dad  continues to help fellow soldiers from his previous command who are retiring - giving them resume advice, education recommendations, and tips for transitioning to the civilian life. He has helped many get jobs in the government sector and other corporations and I am glad that my dad is trying to help these soldiers transition so that they have support and don't feel lost and desperate."

I think you also need to be a fairly afulent country because liberal values are a luxury you can't afford when people are struggling  to stay alive.\n\nWhen the powers that be saw fit to fling our borders wide open to all and sundry they killed our liberal democracy.\n\nIf you are liberal, how can you say that (for example) what we believe in the UK is inherently right and what Islamists believie is inherently wrong? \n\nEither we ENFORCE the Christian values that our country was built upon (and I don't want to see this - I don't want women to be fored to incubate a life if they don't want to; I don't want to see babies born out of wedlock as sinful, I don't want homosexuality frowned upon or deemed 'lesser') or we accept that Islamism will probably prevail.\n\nLiberalism is weak.

A report published in the same year found that of the 43,000 extremists on MI5's watchlist, around nine-tenths of the people on the list are Islamist extremists. In July 2023, Suella Braverman, the Home Secretary of the United Kingdom, reiterated that Islamic terrorism was the primary domestic threat facing the UK. Islamic terrorism represented 67% of attacks since 2018, 75% of MI5's caseload, and 64% of those in custody for terrorism-connected offences according to the 2023 CONTEST report. The Independent Reviewer for the government's anti-terror programme, Sir William Shawcross, has stated that there was a reluctance to investigate Islamist threats due to fears of being labelled Islamophobic or racist. Instead, staff from the government's anti-terror programme were biased towards tackling far-right threats despite Islamist threats posing a greater risk."

Uh, no.  Ali has only attacked the radical extremists of it that preach violence and support terrorism. \nSecondly, Omar says that Islam was created \"in order to fight violence\".  That is laughable in the extreme.  Muhammad, an illiterate merchant and warlord, had tried unsuccessfully to put himself in a position over the various tribes around him.  They rejected him several times.   He spent his life up to that point raiding caravans and slaughtering their men, taking their women as slaves, and raiding towns slaughtering the citizens, and taking women and young girls as sex slaves to be sold on the open market.   He fabricated the religion of Islam to name himself as the \"Final Prophet\" of Allah.  He spread his religion by the threat of death for the remainder of his life.  He bragged about the number of Jews he killed, and \"married\" a Jewish woman after slaughtering her husband, her father and her brother in front of her, adding her to his harem of 13 wives that he already had.  One wonders how much enjoyment he got out of raping his Jewish woman after slaughtering her entire family in front of her. \nThis is in Arabia's own history of Muhammad, and they celebrate it, not hide it or apologize for it. \n\nHe married his six year-old niece Aisha when he was 52, and consummated marriage with her when she was nine and he was 55.  This is the person who fabricated this religion to put himself in power, and this is the religion that Manal Omar believes in and spreads.....\n\nFinally, Manal Omar knows very well that the penalty of leaving Islam is death.  She refuses to address that fact of Islam, and knows that Ayann Hirsi Ali is under threat of death for her entire life because of it.  So she is dishonest from beginning to end here."

Many told him he had no hope and should just not even try. They tore him to shreds.\nWhen I saw the photo, he was actually quite attractive.  Just needed to take care of himself better.

           "Islam should  change the concepts of God, humans and heaven.\n FIRST, God is not someone up there called by only one name Allah and is  only for 'believers' but he is the universal, infinite soul of  super-intelligent , superconsciousness everywhere within his creation from which everything emanated from billions of years ago and will one day the universe will dissolve back into this superconsciousness.  Think of black holes in the universe where galaxies and stars get sucked into nothingness gradually.  God is eternal.  He is also within each and every one of us in the core or 'nucleus'  of our individual consciousness or soul, waiting to be awakened within.  God is not a wrathful, angry  punisher but a pure  lover who loves all his souls unconditionally. He is  absolute truth and pure all-inclusive, immanent love. \nSECOND, we are not this body but we are actually  individual, intelligent consciousness or souls who take on different bodies to experience the temporariness of matter and  ultimately realize the permanence of merging our consciousness with the superconsciousness. .  We  are also eternal as souls.   When clothed in a material body, we have EGO which is  actually an extension of matter. Matter is made of atoms  and molecules that cling to each other giving rise to the  'I' ness and 'mine' ness in us. Ego produces anger, greed, lust, avariciousness, stealing, grabbing, not-sharing, hatred etc.  All scriptures tell man to overcome one's ego to see the spiritual in us and around us.  'Kill the non-believer' verses should not be interpreted literally but metaphorically to mean kill your ego to see the true spiritual self and the true spiritual, universal God. Kill your ego at the 'altar of God'.  We are limited by our material senses to comprehend the infinite and hence  man will naturally have different concepts of the infinite. Hence it is natural to have many beliefs. We each  need to seek  him within to comprehend the infinite, not by killing  'non-believers' but by seeking him within each and everyone of us.\n THIRD, there is no heaven or hell. There is only heavenly states or hellish states of mind. Heaven and hell are actually  on earth by what we humans make of our lives and the  lives of all others by loving everyone and all of his creation in sharing the abundance given by him.\n\nThink universal. Not narrow and parochial."
